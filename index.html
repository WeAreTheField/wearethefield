  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p><span class="emphasis">We are the Field</span> is an advocacy group that seeks to uplift humanities scholars in an uncertain sociopolitical and economic climate.</p>
    <p>We have two primary actionable goals:
      <br>Equity and Inclusion for Non-Affiliated Scholars
        <ul>
          <li>We believe that scholarly communities should better reflect their constituencies with consideration to the academic hiring crisis in North America. We are researching to better understand how non-affiliated scholars are involved in scholarly communities, and how scholarly communities support scholars in precarious occupational positions.</li>
          <li>Our analysis will demonstrate that non-affiliated scholars need additional support from academic institutions in order to stay relevant in their fields during post-graduate occupational shifts and beyond. We will also suggest ways in which academic societies, granting institutions, universities, and publishers can modify their programs and procedures to fit the needs of the diverse occupations and research habits of an increasingly non-affiliated scholarly base.</li>
          <li>Additionally, We are the Field offers practical data collection, analysis, and visualization training for humanists who are interested in adding research from their fields to our growing body of studies.</li></ul>
    <br>Sustainable Self-Management of Scholarly Life
      <ul>
        <li>As of 2024, we acknowledge the heightened volatility of social media communities that many scholars have used to connect with researchers from around the world and promote their work for a decade. We believe that scholars should be empowered to self-manage their online scholarly identities without relying on the changing landscape of online communities.</li>
        <li>We advocate for and provide training materials to help scholars learn low-tech skills to build their own static websites or repositories to present and discuss research in progress, and to preserve thoughts and workflows that might otherwise have been shared in online communities.</li>
        <li>We encourage scholars to consider challenging the primacy of third-party online communites in order to prioritize freedom of expression and self-preservation.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Our Method</h2>
    <p id="method"><span class="emphasis">We are the Field</span> calls for research that elucidates a fuller picture of granting, alum resources, conference participation, and publishing for scholars outside of academia. We encourage studies and surveys of the following:
	   <div class="list">
      <ol>
      	<li>Granting
          <ul>- How many humanities grant programs for research, scholarly projects, community projects, etc., target scholars outside of academia?</ul>
          <ul>- How many scholars outside academia earn grants that are open to all scholars regardless of institutional affiliation?</ul>
          <ul>- What kind of grant programs from state and federal humanities agencies or academic societies should be created to fit the reality of post-graduate scholarly life?</ul>
        </li>

      <br>
      <li>Alum/non-affiliated scholar access to scholarly resources
        <ul>- Are the library resources and databases available to alum suitable for competitive and thorough research for multiple disciplines?</ul>
        <ul>- What are the possible creative solutions for providing better resources and databases to alum?</ul>
        <ul>- Are there other options for scholarly access besides alum access?</ul>
      </li>

      <br>
      <li>Conferences and academic societies
        <ul>- How many non-affiliated scholars present papers at major conferences in various fields?</ul>
        <ul>- Do any societies collect statistics on the affiliations of those who submit papers to conferences? Do we know the acceptance rate for affiliated and non-affiliated scholars?</ul>
      </li>

      <br>
      <li>Publishing
        <ul>- How can we gauge the level of interest in academic publishing among non-affiliated scholars?</ul>
        <ul>- If scholars outside of academia published more often, how could that positively affect the publishing industry?</ul>
        <ul>- What are worthwhile and productive alternatives to traditional scholarly publishing?
      </li>
    </ol>
