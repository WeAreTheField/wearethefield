<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p><span class="emphasis">We are the Field</span> is an advocacy research initiative to uplift non-affiliated humanities scholars. We believe that scholarly communities should better reflect their constituencies with consideration to the academic hiring crisis in North America. We are researching to better understand how non-affiliated scholars are involved in scholarly communities. Our analysis will demonstrate that non-affiliated scholars need additional support from academic institutions, and suggest ways in which academic societies, granting institutions, universities, and publishers can modify their programs and procedures to fit the needs of the diverse occupations and research habits of an increasingly non-affiliated scholarly base.

<div class="paragraph">
<h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p id="philosophy"><a href="https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2022">There are more recent humanities* PhDs without tenure-track jobs than with.</a>
</p>
</div>

<div class="stat">"The AHA's Where Historians Work survey, which looks at a broader snapshot of time, suggests an upper bound: for those who graduated from a PhD program in 2017, 27 percent (231 of 860) were employed in TT positions four years later in 2021. This contrasts starkly with the data from earlier cohorts. Of those who earned their PhDs in 2013, for example, 54 percent (511 of 944) were employed in TT jobs after four years."</div>



<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do not have current statistics that portray the gravity of this situation due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. But we do have dozens of studies, think pieces, and blog posts about this issue, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2013/05/22/essay-defining-alt-ac-new-phd-job-searches">stemming back to 2010 at the latest</a>. We also have "alt-ac," "PhD Plus," and other euphemistic programs in a growing number of graduate departments, a sign that higher education administrators recognize that many of us will not receive academic appointments.
</p>
</div>

<div class="stat">"First used on Twitter around three years ago in a conversation between Bethany Nowviskie and Jason Rhody 'alt-ac' was shorthand for 'alternative academic' careers. At the time the term was, in <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2010/alt-ac/" target="_blank">Nowviskie's words</a>, 'a pointed push-back against the predominant phrase, 'nonacademic careers.' 'Non-academic' was the label for anything off the straight and narrow path to tenure.' Three years later, the term 'alt-ac' is commonly used to refer to 'alternative' careers in (and beyond) the academy."</div>


<div class="paragraph">
<p> Many of us have found fulfilling careers outside of academia or adjacent institutions (or never even applied to a tenure-track job), but some have resorted to career paths that were at one point unfathomable. Whatever the case, we all were, at one point, passionate about research, writing, and our scholarly communities. But we now find those scholarly activities and connections challenging to maintain as we work and live outside of academic institutions.
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scholarly life is fostered in a system that was not designed for us. But there are more of us.
</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sarah Buchmeier, PhD and park ranger, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/does-leaving-the-university-mean-leaving-academe">wrote about this issue in 2022 in the Chronicle of Higher Education.</a> Her essay describes the professional stigma against PhD candidates not in the academic job market and her experience trying to be a scholar outside of academia. It is one of the only published pieces of writing we have regarding the ability of "alt-ac" PhDs to stay in their scholarly communities. But her arguments and questions are anecdotal. Our belief that PhDs outside of academia are left out of scholarly communities is also anecdotal as there are no large-scale research initiatives on this matter—yet. But we firmly believe it is true.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stat">"Academic conferences now routinely trot out independent scholars for panels on career diversity—but how often are those speakers invited to present their scholarship?"</div></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-affiliated scholars need to feel more emboldened to continue researching and sharing their work. But each of those activities is more difficult outside of academia. Despite open access advocacy efforts, many research databases are unavailable to non-affiliated scholars. In addition, research grants are tailored to the needs and schedules of professors, and are likely not equitably awarded to non-affiliated scholars. This lack of opportunity and time to conduct new, exciting research restricts our ability to share our ideas and scholarship. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scholarly communities must reorient their activities to align with reality: most of us will not be in prestigious positions. Positions in academia or adjacent institutions tangibly benefit from scholarly publishing, conference presentations, and research granting to earn promotions or further their relevancy. And importantly, these positions have a mutually beneficial relationship with the granting agencies, nonprofits, and publishers that depend on the labor and products of high-profile scholars.
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those of us whose promotions and relevancy do not depend on a high-profile journal article, for example, are just as worthy of participating in the scholarly community as our colleagues with tenure-track jobs. <span class="emphasis">After all, there are more of us.</span> And imagine how rich, diverse, and complex scholarly discourse could be if its participants were a grants manager, a government analyst, a UX designer, and a full-time parent or caregiver, particularly when that would allow scholars who have historically been left out of scholarly communities to participate.
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, there are many resources directed toward getting a job outside academia, or even how to transition from outside academia back into an academic career. Likewise, there are <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/altacchats">forums dedicated to alt-ac struggles</a>. But there are no comprehensive resources for those of us who accept the job outlook but want to continue our scholarly endeavors.
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how can <span class="emphasis">all</span> scholars participate in scholarly life, regardless of position or title? We need all of the institutions within higher education to support us: our alma maters, granting agencies, and academic societies. How can they do more to serve the largest amount of recent scholars? 
</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<h2>Our Method</h2>
  <p id="method"><span class="emphasis">We are the Field</span> calls for research that elucidates a fuller picture of granting, alum resources, conference participation, and publishing for scholars outside of academia. We should engage in studies and surveys of the following:
	<div class="list">
  <ol>
  	<li>Granting
      <ul>- Beyond postdoctoral fellowships in the "public humanities," how many humanities grant programs for research, scholarly projects, community projects, etc., target scholars outside of academia?</ul>
      <ul>- How many scholars outside academia earn grants that are open to all scholars regardless of institutional affiliation?</ul>
      <ul>- What kind of grant programs from state and federal humanities agencies or academic societies should be created to fit the reality of post-graduate scholarly life?</ul>
    </li>

  <br>
  <li>Alum/non-affiliated scholar access to scholarly resources
    <ul>- Are the library resources and databases available to alum suitable for competitive and thorough research for multiple disciplines?</ul>
    <ul>- What are the possible creative solutions for providing better resources and databases to alum?</ul>
    <ul>- Are there other options for scholarly access besides alum access?</ul>
  </li>

  <br>
  <li>Conferences and academic societies
    <ul>- How many non-affiliated scholars present papers at major conferences in various fields?</ul>
    <ul>- Do any societies collect statistics on the affiliations of those who submit papers to conferences? Do we know the acceptance rate for affiliated and non-affiliated scholars?</ul>
  </li>

  <br>
  <li>Publishing
    <ul>- The need to publish for tenure-track professors has created a predatory scholarly publishing industry. 
      <ul>- (And an internal question, <em>if we are not professors, why would we willingly participate if our careers do not depend on it? &nbsp;</em>)</ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>- How can we gauge the level of interest in academic publishing among non-affiliated scholars?</ul>
    <ul>- If scholars outside of academia published more often, how could that affect the publishing industry?</ul>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>
</p>
